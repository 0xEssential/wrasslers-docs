# $WRASSPLayer Experiment

Wrasslers is running a timed experiment to learn about permissionless play-to-earn gaming tokenomics. This **Beta** experience runs until January 1, 2022. Wrasslers is introducing an ERC20 token $WRASSPL that can be used to upgrade Wrassler attributes for participation in a New Year's auto-battler tournament.

**$WRASSPL becomes valueless on January 1, 2022.** The ERC20 contract prevents transfers after 1/1/2022. There is no long-term value in $WRASSPL. The token's sole utility is in exchange for  skill points in a strategy-based wrestling game.

Projects that register for Wrasslers will receive 10,000 $WRASSPL per token in their collection. NFT owners who register their tokens will receive 10,000 $WRASSPL for each NFT they register. Wrassler attributes are sold on a curve where the upgrade cost is `(newValue^2 - startingValue^2) x 0.01`.

To upgrade a Wrassler's power from `320` to `420` would cost 740 $WRASSPL, while upgrading from `420` to `520` would cost 940 $WRASSPL. Skill points get more expensive as your Wrassler improves.

$WRASSPL is a tradeable ERC20 token. Projects are free to distribute $WRASSPL to their community, and players can consolidate $WRASSPL to upgrade a single NFT. Holders are also free to trade $WRASSPL on decentralized exchanges. Wrasslers pre-minted 1,000,000 $WRASSPL 

$WRASSPL is burned when spent on attribute upgrades, reducing token supply. In a perfect market, all $WRASSPL will be spent on attribute upgrades, resulting in 0 supply on 1/1/2021.
