## Why Integrate

Wrasslers believes that NFT developers and game developers can find **positive sum** outcomes by working together permissionlessly. Rather than entering one-off partnerships with metaverse experiences, NFT projects can become interoperable building blocks that game developers use in their projects, without having to build specific integrations or negotiate deals. Integrating your NFT avatar project with Wrasslers enables this composability.

Integration is permissionless, on-chain and offers revenue share to project owners.

## Positive sum outcomes

When a project's NFTs are imbued with wrestling capabilities, they can be used in any game that builds on top of the Wrasslers protocol standard. As more game experiences are built on top of Wrasslers, more value will accrue to your tokens as Wrassleable entities - gaming utility attracts new types of owners while game mechanics can allow owners to increase value through gameplay. Game developers benefit by attracting a passionate user base, creating a flywheel of value and adoption. 

Skills are attached to the NFT, not the player, so when a community member sells one of your tokens, they are also selling the accumulated skills they've built up for the NFT. Wrasslers adds a play-to-earn layer to your existing NFTs by letting them accumulate value through gameplay.

Registering with Wrasslers does not lock, wrap or stake tokens, so integrating with Wrasslers does not prevent you or your community from using their tokens for other purposes. You can still build your own walled garden game, but building one using Wrassler's attributes and composing the XP game loop into your experiences will drive more value to your tokens.

## Registration

You can register a project for free or pay the cost for randomizing your collection's starting stats with Chainlink VRF - randomly assigned starting attributes will be higher than those from projects who register for free. You can integrate your project permissionlessly with an Ethereum mainnet transaction, paying transaction fees. Wrasslers also offers a centralized frontend that allows you to register a project with a meta transaction where Wrasslers covering transaction fees.

Once your project is registered, your token owners can register individual tokens. Wrasslers provides a front-end for registration through our games and developer tools to add Wrassler token registration to your own experiences. When an NFT registered with Wrasslers is transferred the protocol offers both L1 and Polygon functions for updating ownership data on the protocol. Wrasslers also offers developer tools that provide live L1 authorization for games built on Polygon or off-chain.


## Revenue share

Wrassler stats can be upgraded by spending $MATIC. When a token from your project is upgraded, your project's owner address will receive 50% of spend. Rev-share is enforced by the protocol in a pull-payment model. This approach is temporary as we explore models for a protocol token.

Upgrading stats is permissionless, so your project can upgrade stats for tokens from your project, or offer upgrades as incentives to your community. The rev-share means you can buy these upgrades at 50% discount. Game developers can also use upgrades as incentives in their games,
