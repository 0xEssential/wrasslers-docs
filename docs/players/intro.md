The Wrasslers ecosystem allows NFT owners to play wrestling games with their NFT avatars to win $WRASSXP that can be used to upgrade skills.

The ecosystem is designed to be open to many game developers, allowing your accumulated skills to be used in many different games.

At launch, Wrasslers provides two game modes - a single player vs. blockchain CPU game and a single-elimination auto-battler tournament game with weekly competitions.
