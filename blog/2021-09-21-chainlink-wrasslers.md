# Wrasslers Using Chainlink VRF to Help Power Provably Fair and Permissionless NFT Gaming

![alt_text](/img/cl-image1.png "Wrasslers x Chainlink")


Wrasslers is a new NFT gaming platform launched by 0xEssential that depends heavily on [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf)—a verifiably tamper-proof random number generator. The Wrasslers alpha release allows players to choose any Ethereum-based NFT they own as the basis for creating a Wrassler with statistical attributes that describe the Wrassler’s skills. Players can then compete in turn-based matches against Wrassler’s blockchain CPU characters. Chainlink VRF is already live on Polygon mainnet and being used to randomize a Wrassler’s starting stats, as well as to provide a randomization seed to each match, allowing for increased variance in gameplay and match outcomes.

“Using Chainlink VRF for Wrasslers was a no-brainer,” said Sammy Bauch, founder of 0xEssential, the parent company behind Wrasslers. “Chainlink was a big help on my first NFT project CryptOrchids, and Chainlink VRF is even more reliable, fast, and cost-efficient on the Polygon network.”

# Adding Portable Utility to NFTs to Create Open Metaverse Gaming Experiences

Wrasslers isn’t your typical NFT PFP project. Gaming isn’t a future roadmap item - Wrasslers Genesis NFTs will launch with Day 1 gaming utility. And Wrasslers isn’t building a vertically integrated walled-garden game. Wrasslers and the Metaverse Wrassling Federation will be open to any NFT project that implements the Wrassleable standard and will offer play to earn revenue share to projects that integrate with the permissionless gaming platform.

Wrasslers offers developers open-source inheritable smart contracts that make it simple to craft NFT projects that are compatible with the gaming platform. NFT projects can choose whether to allow holders to migrate their NFTs to the Polygon chain for Wrasslers gaming or to create NFTs that live exclusively on the Polygon chain. Once players are registered in the game they will be able to challenge other players to turn-based matches. In the alpha release, players are limited to playing single-player matches against the blockchain CPU, with a game lobby beta release slated for Q1 2022.

Match outcomes are determined by each competitor’s Wrassler attributes, gameplay decision making, and Chainlink VRF. Chainlink VRF provides each match a randomization seed. That seed is used throughout the match to determine which three moves are available to a player at each turn, and to add a luck coefficient to each performed move to increase the variance in outcomes. No two matches played between the same two players will ever be the same!

Chainlink VRF works by combining block data that is still unknown when the request is made with the oracle node's pre-committed private key to generate both a random number and a cryptographic proof. The Wrasslers smart contract will only accept the random number input if it has a valid cryptographic proof, and the cryptographic proof can only be generated if the VRF process is tamper-proof. This helps provide users with automated and publicly verifiable proof directly on-chain that Wrassler stat generation and match outcomes are provably fair and were not tampered with or predicted by the oracle, outside entities, or the Wrasslers team.

While the use of Chainlink VRF will increase alongside the growth in matchplay, we predict deeper integration with other Chainlink decentralized services in the future, such as bringing Chainlink Keepers to the Polygon network for automating certain smart contract processes.
