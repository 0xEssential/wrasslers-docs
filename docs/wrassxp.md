## Purpose & utility

$WRASSXP is a game utility token for upgrading Wrassler attributes on the open Wrasslers protocol. The ERC20 token has an **unlimited variable supply** and is mined whenever projects or NFT owners register for Wrasslers. $WRASSXP can be spent to upgrade a token's attributes, returning 20% of spend to the NFT project creator. Game developers can use Wrassler attributes in their games and reward users with $WRASSXP for accomplishments. $WRASSXP is an open XP system for wrestling characters in the metaverse.

## Supply

### Minting

$WRASSXP is minted whenever an NFT project or owner registers for the protocol. 25% of tokens are granted to the registrant, with the remaining 75% going to the Wrasslers treasury to enable $WRASSXP rewards in games that use the protocol.

### Earning

Players can earn $WRASSXP through in-game achievements. Wrasslers offers a single-player vs. blockchain CPU game mode where you can fight increasingly skilled Wrasslers in an on-chain turn-based game. You earn $WRASSXP for winning matches. Rewards increase as you progress, but the more difficult opponents may require you to spend $WRASSXP to upgrade your skills. Players can earn up to 5,760 $WRASSXP by beating all blockchain opponents.

### Spending

Players can spend $WRASSXP to upgrade their Wrasslers' skills. 20% of spend is shared with the NFT project creator, with the remaining 80% returning to the Wrasslers treasury. 

## For NFT projects

Projects that register for Wrasslers will receive 25 $WRASSXP per NFT in their collection. Projects are free to distribute $WRASSXP to their community, trade or hold these tokens, but $WRASSXP's purpose is upgrading Wrassler attributes.

Projects receive a 20% share when token owners use $WRASSXP to upgrade skills on the Wrasslers protocol. The remaining $WRASSXP goes to the Wrasslers Treasury to enable rewards in games that use the Wrasslers protocol.

## For players

NFT owners who register a token will receive 2,000 $WRASSXP once per address. Holders are free to trade $WRASSXP on decentralized exchanges or consolidate $WRASSXP to upgrade a single NFT.

Wrasslers offers two game modes - the single player earning mode and an auto-battler tournament mode. In tournament mode, eligible tokens are entered in a single-elimination tournament that Wrasslers plans to run weekly. Matches are performed on-chain between seeded NFT opponents until a champion is crowned. Wrasslers plans to offer prizes for these tournaments, including $WRASSXP and other rewards.

Wrassler attributes are sold on a curve where the upgrade cost is `(newValue^2 - startingValue^2) x 0.01`. Skill points get more expensive as your Wrassler improves. To upgrade a Wrassler's power from `320` to `420` would cost 740 $WRASSXP, while upgrading from `420` to `520` would cost 940 $WRASSXP.


## Price factors

Because $WRASSXP is minted for each NFT project and token that registers the supply is highly unpredictable. To maintain integrity, only projects chosen by the Wrasslers team are granted $WRASSXP. We intend to decentralize this authority, but need to protect against manipulation.

The Wrasslers treasury also grows significantly with each project. The intent of the treasury is to enable in-game rewards. With more players the treasury needs to grow accordingly to provide rewards.

The Wrasslers skill points sales curve and new game modes like tournaments and royal rumbles from Wrasslers or other publishers help maintain demand over time.
